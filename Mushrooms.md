# Mushrooms

For example, both mushrooms and mammals need to constantly defend themselves against bacteria infections. One way a mushroom will defend against bacteria is by producing chemicals that kill bacteria.

Penicillin is a chemical that is naturally produced in a mushroom called Penicillium chrysogenum. This mushroom produces penicillin to defend itself against bacteria. When we eat this chemical, it does the same job in our body.

## Chaga

Chaga do not have an easy life. Their struggle for survival is especially intense. They grow in extremely cold forests where they’re exposed to freezing temperatures, snow and ice. Their summers are very hot, which means they experience lots of UV radiation. Most importantly, they are constantly in competition with lots of tiny and dangerous creatures (bacteria, worms, fungus, ext.)

Here are a few of the chemicals produced by Chaga that are also biologically active in humans:
- Melanin
- Antioxidant enzymes
- Triterpenoids
- Ergosterols
- Sesquiterpenes
- Betulinic acid
- Polysaccharides
- Phytosterols

Multiple laboratory and animal studies have demonstrated the ability of these biologically active Chaga chemicals to exert a beneficial effect on mammalian physiology.

- kill cancer cells (Glamočlija, 2015; Ning, 2014; Lee 2009; Kang, 2015)
- reduce damaging inflammation (Mishra, 2012)
- boost the immune system (Ko, 2011; Park, 2005
relieve pain (Park, 2005)
- increase stamina/reduce fatigue (Yue, 2015)
act as an antioxidant (Najafzadeh, 2007; Giridharan 2011)

2011, Korean, animal model experiment
- Th1 and Th2 cytokine secretion levels from immune cells in the spleen of a mouse
- Cytokines are the chemical messengers of our immune system
- This shift in cytokines then altered the production of antigen-specific antibody producing cells.
- The production of antibodies is a key component to a fully functional immune system.

A 2015 paper further reveals the ability of Chaga mushrooms to defend against infectious bacteria (Glamočlijaa, 2015)
- In order for bacteria to grow and become toxic inside a human body, the bacteria need to effectively communicate with each other.
- This bacteria to bacteria communication is called quorum sensing (Zhang, 2004).
- Chemicals in Chaga mushrooms can disrupt this communication.
- This disruption is called anti-quorum sensing.
- These scientists found that Chaga extracts showed definite anti-quorum sensing activity against a common and dangerous bacteria named Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
- The data suggest that by disrupting bacteria’s ability to communicate with each other, Chaga mushrooms can help us defend against bacterial infection.

Prevention of oxidative damage

- Free radicals can cause oxidative damage.
- A free radical is any molecule that has an unpaired electron in its outer shell.
- These free radicals bounce around the cells in our body and can cause damage to other molecules, such as our DNA
- The free radical theory of aging claims that humans become old because their cells accumulate free radical damage over time https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Free-radical_theory_of_aging
In some model organisms, such as yeast and Drosophila, there is evidence that reducing oxidative damage can extend lifespan.[7] However, in mice, only 1 of the 18 genetic alterations (SOD-1 deletion) that block antioxidant defences, shortened lifespan.[8] Similarly, in roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans), blocking the production of the naturally occurring antioxidant superoxide dismutase has recently been shown to increase lifespan.[9] Whether reducing oxidative damage below normal levels is sufficient to extend lifespan remains an open and controversial question.
Challenges: Naked mole-rat, birds
- Multiple reports demonstrate that treatment with Chaga mushrooms delivers antioxidant activity (Park, 2004; Najafzadeh, 2007). 
- One interesting report describes how an alcohol extract of Chaga significantly reduced oxidative damage within the lymphocytes of human patients suffering from Irritable Bowell Disease (IBD).
- IBD is partially caused by oxidative stress from free radicals. In theory, if one were to increase antioxidant levels in their body, this would reduce the detrimental effects of IBD. These scientists isolated lymphocte cells from IBD patients and treat the cells with Chaga mushroom extract. They found that Chaga mushrooms increased protection against the oxidative damage to the DNA of these lymphocytes (Najafzadeh, 2007). This paper strongly suggests that chemicals in Chaga have potent antioxidant capabilities.
