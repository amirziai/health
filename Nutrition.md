# Nutrition

### Is there one diet?

### What are your goals?
What is health? These can be conflicting
- Maximize muscle
- Reduce fat
- Cognitive performance
- Longevity
- Sex drive
- Hormonal balance
- Homeostasis
- Preventing disease
- ...

### Individual experimentation
- What evidence do you need to adopt something (as in what's the burden of proof)? If a certain nutrient or diet results in better overall mood, performance, and test results for an individual is that enough? Objections are usually taste, status quo bias (what we already do must be good), and cost.

### Problems with nutrition research
- Complex system
- Measurement issues (e.g. FFQ) (memory, lying, etc)
- In vivo vs in vitro studies
- Hierarchy of evidence
- Controlling factors
- Interaction with other foods, enzymes, hormones, genetics, etc
- Genetics, epigenetics
- Spurious correlation
- Rigorous methodology

### Claim
- You have to eat something
- Nutrition plays a major role (define major) in performance (cognitive, energy, health, bone density, heart rate)
-- Define a number of metrics to compare
-- Counter argument: doesnâ€™t really matter
