# Nutrition

### Is there one diet?
http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-cant-trust-what-you-read-about-nutrition/

### What are your goals?
What is health? These can be conflicting
- Maximize muscle
- Reduce fat
- Cognitive performance
- Longevity
- Sex drive
- Hormonal balance
- Homeostasis
- Preventing disease
- ...

### Individual experimentation
- What evidence do you need to adopt something (as in what's the burden of proof)? If a certain nutrient or diet results in better overall mood, performance, and test results for an individual is that enough? Objections are usually taste, status quo bias (what we already do must be good), and cost.

### Problems with nutrition research
- Complex system
- Measurement issues (e.g. FFQ) (memory, lying, etc)
- In vivo vs in vitro studies
- Hierarchy of evidence
- Controlling factors
- Interaction with other foods, enzymes, hormones, genetics, etc
- Genetics, epigenetics
- Spurious correlation
- Rigorous methodology

### Claim
- You have to eat something
- Nutrition plays a major role (define major) in performance (cognitive, energy, health, bone density, heart rate)
-- Define a number of metrics to compare
-- Counter argument: doesnâ€™t really matter

### Mitochondria
- Bacteria that take oxygen and produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
- All comes from your mother
- Average human cell has 1-2 thousand mitochondria
- Brain, retina, and heart have 10,000
- In total we have 1 quadrillion
- Entire respiratory system (heart, lung, blood) exists to deliver oxygen to mitochondria
- ATP has been known for 100 years
- ATP is broken into ADP + P
- ADP is recycled by reattaching P and making ATP again
- There are 1B ATP molecules of ATP in the average cell, recycled 3 times per minute
- Liver mitochondria has an enzyme needed to detox ammonia, waste product of protein breakdown
- From age 30-70 the average mitochondrion decreases in efficiency by about 50%
- Avoid Early Onset Mitochondrial Dysfunction (EOMD), this is not an actual term, http://www.bcmj.org/articles/mitochondrial-disease-clinical-manifestations-overview
- EOMD reversible, mitochondrial decay is not

#### Inefficient coupling
- Krebs cycle
- Sugar (or protein) -> glucose or fat into ketone body (water-soluble molecule that liver produces from fatty acids) called beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)
- Glucose and BHB can provide carbon and electrons which are needed for energy creation
- These form a molecule called Acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) that kicks off Krebs
